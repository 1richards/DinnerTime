# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 10 phases at fine granularity, core thesis (photo -> suggestions) validated in phases 3-4
- Roadmap: Voice cooking uses STT -> Claude API -> TTS pipeline (no real-time voice API)
- Roadmap: Hono over Express/Fastify for backend (research recommendation)
- Roadmap: FOUN-07 (offline) deferred to Phase 10 -- offline caching layers on after core features exist
- [Phase 01]: Used hoisted node-linker for React Native/Metro bundler compatibility
- [Phase 01]: Server conditionally starts (skips in NODE_ENV=test) for clean Hono test client usage
- [Phase 01]: Profiles trigger extracts display_name from user metadata on signup
- [Phase 01]: Used vi.hoisted() for Vitest mock variables to work with vi.mock hoisting
- [Phase 01]: 3-step onboarding wizard: name, household (with kids toggle), cuisine and dietary preferences
- [Phase 01]: EAS development profile uses simulator distribution for local iOS testing
- [Phase 01]: Bundle identifier set to com.dinnertime.app

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Apply for Instacart Developer Platform API access early (approval timeline unknown, needed by Phase 8)
- Claude Vision accuracy for real fridge photos needs empirical validation in Phase 3
- expo-speech-recognition is pre-1.0 -- may need Whisper fallback for Phase 9
