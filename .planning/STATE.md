# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-07)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 10 phases at fine granularity, core thesis (photo -> suggestions) validated in phases 3-4
- Roadmap: Voice cooking uses STT -> Claude API -> TTS pipeline (no real-time voice API)
- Roadmap: Hono over Express/Fastify for backend (research recommendation)
- Roadmap: FOUN-07 (offline) deferred to Phase 10 -- offline caching layers on after core features exist
- [Phase 01]: Used hoisted node-linker for React Native/Metro bundler compatibility
- [Phase 01]: Server conditionally starts (skips in NODE_ENV=test) for clean Hono test client usage
- [Phase 01]: Profiles trigger extracts display_name from user metadata on signup
- [Phase 01]: Used vi.hoisted() for Vitest mock variables to work with vi.mock hoisting
- [Phase 01]: 3-step onboarding wizard: name, household (with kids toggle), cuisine and dietary preferences
- [Phase 01]: EAS development profile uses simulator distribution for local iOS testing
- [Phase 01]: Bundle identifier set to com.dinnertime.app
- [Phase 02]: dietary_restrictions (soft) vs dietary_allergies (hard) as separate JSONB columns per member
- [Phase 02]: 261 curated ingredients across 10 categories for dislike search with local filtering
- [Phase 02]: Optimistic Zustand updates with Supabase rollback for all preference mutations
- [Phase 02]: useDeferredValue (React 19) for ingredient search instead of manual debounce
- [Phase 02]: Dietary summary section is read-only aggregation; per-member editing in MemberFormModal
- [Phase 02]: Allergies use red chip color to visually distinguish from soft dietary preferences
- [Phase 03]: Anthropic client as lazy singleton using env getter pattern for testability
- [Phase 03]: PantryItem quantity as number (not integer) to support fractional amounts like 0.5 lb
- [Phase 03]: ScanResult type defined locally in vision.ts (server does not share types with mobile)
- [Phase 03]: Reconciliation uses select-then-insert/update pattern for clarity over Supabase upsert
- [Phase 03]: Backend API calls use fetch with Supabase auth token for scan/confirm endpoints
- [Phase 03]: Confidence decay: 7-day grace period, linear 0.05/day reduction, floor at 0.1

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Apply for Instacart Developer Platform API access early (approval timeline unknown, needed by Phase 8)
- Claude Vision accuracy for real fridge photos needs empirical validation in Phase 3
- expo-speech-recognition is pre-1.0 -- may need Whisper fallback for Phase 9
